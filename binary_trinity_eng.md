## Create a character
Choose three archetypes, tropes or any description of choice to define your character. Best is an adjective+noun. Each one is a **dictum**.
Assign each dictum one of the following score: 1,2,3.

## Action resolution
Always describe what your characters does. When there is a chance of failure toss a number of coins equal to the score of the relevant *dictum*. 
Heads are equal to 1, tail are equal to 0. Sum the results.
A natural 0 or 3 is **Critical** (failure/success).

### Conflict
A conflict is an action in which two opponents confront one another.
Each opponent toss the relevant number of coins. Who scores higher wins. Ties extend the conflict (narratively). Describe a *Critical* as an exceptional result of the conflict.
The winner chooses the opponent's fate.

### Other actions
When the character attemps some action that is not a conflict, determine the action difficulty by the following scale: 1 - Routine; 2 - Difficult; 3- Hard.
Remember that both success and failure have consequences, narrate accordingly.
